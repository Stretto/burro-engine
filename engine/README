PORT AND CONNECTION

The script engine speaks to TCP port 37147.  Since the connection is a
purely raw connection, one needs a terminal client program that can
communicate in raw.  Putty is one.  The 'ncat' command, which is part
of the 'nmap' family of programs from https://nmap.org, is another.
I'm using netcat.

Connecting to the server by using 'ncat localhost 37147'.

FINDING COMMANDS VIA APROPOS

Remember that the console has the "apropos" meta-command, which is
entered as ',a'.  If you use that meta-command with a part of a
procedure name, it will return all the procedures with that string
in the name.
