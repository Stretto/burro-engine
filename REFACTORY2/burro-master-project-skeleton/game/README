Burro-game is the game logic for the Project Burro game engine.  It is
in charge of keeping track of game state.

Once launched, it connects to the burro-gui subprogram and interacts
with it over a pipe.

It receives from burro-gui a set of messages mostly having to do with
user interactions or timer states.  It sends to burro-gui messages
largely having to do with loading art or music or moving sprites and
backgrounds.  The specific messages are defined in libburro.
