Burro-gui is the main user interface for the Project Burro game
engine.  It is in charge of drawing to the screen, interacting with
the audio, caching game art, and monitoring user interactions.  It has
no game logic and, by itself, does nothing interesting.

Once launched, it connects to the burro-game subprogram and interacts
with it over a pipe.

It sends to burro-game a set of messages mostly having to do with user
interactions or timer states.  It listens for messages largely having
to do with loading art or music or moving sprites and backgrounds.
The specific messages are defined in libburro.
