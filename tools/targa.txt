			TARGA PIXEL ART HOWTO

I chose Targa files because they are simple, have lossless
compression, and can handle the various functions necessary for pixel
art.  Later, I found out that many tools have broken implementations
outside of the most common formats.

================
GIMP
================

Gimp has a nasty habit of modifying the internal data reprsentation of
the image.

Color-mapped files are a particular problem

1. Color-mapped images with 32-bit color-map entries become 32-bit
true color RGBA, regardless of the number of entries in the color map.

2. Color-mapped files with more than 256 color map entries become RGB
images.

3. Color-mapped files with any alpha or overlay bits become 32-bit
RGBA.

4. Color-mapped files with 16-bit indices are not handled at all.

- So, only color-mapped files with 256 or fewer entries and 24-bit
  color stay unmodified, so, using a key color becomes a requirement
  for transparency.

High-color Images

1. 15-bit and 16-bit high-color images are upsampled to 24-bit and
32-bit

2. If the Overlay bit is high, it indicates that we should be transparent,
e.g. have an alpha of of zero.  This behavior is swapped in Gimp.

WORKAROUNDS

MAP

The tile sheet for maps is 32 tiles by 32 tiles, or 1024 tiles.  Thus,
the map image needs to be 10-bit greyscale, which I was expecting to
store at 16-bit greyscale.  This is impossible to edit in Gimp.

16-bit greyscale is coming in Gimp 2.10.

Whatever.  I'll edit them as a text file of 16-bit 4-digit hex vals
and have  `targatool' convert them to a 16-bit TGA anyway.

TILESHEET and BMP8

Tilesheets are supposed to be 8-bit indices with 16-bit palettes with
the high bit being an overlay bit.  Instead, I'll edit them as 8-bit
indices with RGB_888 palettes and magenta being the key color, and use
`targatool' to convert them to 8-bit indices with ORGB_1555 palettes.

BMP16

High color bitmaps are supposed to be ORGB_1555.  I'll edit them as
32-bit ARGB_8888, and use `targatool' to convert them to ORGB_1555
high-color.
