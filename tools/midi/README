Converting MIDI to waveforms is a three step process.

1. First, a midi file is unpacked.  This results in a note list, which
is a five-column table.

  - Time: seconds since the beginning of the song
  - Channel:  a number 0 to 15.
  - Patch: a number that indicates the instrument for the note
  - Note: a midi note number that indicates the pitch of the note (or a
    non-tuned percussion instrument number)
  - Duration: the length of the note
  - Velocity: volume?
  - Percussion: when true, the note number is non-tuned percussion
    instrument number

2. Then, a waveform list is generated.  The waveform list describes an
"attack, decay, sustain, release" waveform.  The envelope has
five critical points.

   PHASE            AMPLITUDE    FREQUENCY   TIME      
1  Begin attack     0            F_initial   0         
2  Begin decay      A_attack     F_attack    D_attack  
3  Begin sustain    A_sustain    F_sustain   D_attack + D_decay   
4  Begin release    A_sustain    F_sustain   D_attack + D_decay + D_sustain 
5  End release      0            F_release   D_attack + D_decay + D_sustain + D_release 

Also, it has 3 parameters
- Waveform: 0 = square, 1 = sinusoid
- Noise: 0 = tone, 1 = noise
- Duty: 0 to 1, relative width of the 1st half of the wave form

To convert a note list to a waveform list, there needs to be
a mapping transform from

   {channel, patch, note, duration, velocity}
   to 
   {A_attack, A_sustain, F_initial, F_attack, F_sustain, F_release,
   D_attack, D_decay, D_sustain, D_release, Waveform, Noise, Duty}

Guidance about this mapping could be found in the General MIDI Level 1
Instrument Patch Map.

There's no real point in trying to actually mimic these instruments
perfectly, but, we can ballpark it.

Piano-like instruments
Attack 10ms           a few cents higher
Decay  600ms to 20%
Sustain      at 20%
Release 10ms      

String-like instruments
Attack 100ms
Decay  0 ms  to 100%
Sustain      at 100%
Release 100ms
