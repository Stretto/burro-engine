burro-engine
============

This is the README for the Project Burro Game Engine version 0.1.  This is
currently pre-alpha code.  I'm aiming for Dec 2014 release.  The nickname for
version Project Burro v0.1 is "Common Markdown".

This is a 2D game engine I started writing on a whim after reading about the
internals of the Nintendo DS's 2D engine.  I really liked the idea of the
challenge of what was essentially a Nintendo DS simulator.

It is yet another 2D game engine in SDL2 in C/C++ with some JavaScript for the
game logic.

This code not yet usable in any fashion.
