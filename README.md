============

This is the README for the Project Burro Game Engine version 0.1.  This is currently
pre-alpha code.  I'm aiming for Nov 2014 release.  The nickname for version 0.1 is
"Common Markdown".

This is a 2D game engine I started writing on a whim after reading about the
internals of the Nintendo DS's 2D engine.  I really liked the idea of the
challenge of what was essentially a Nintendo DS simulator.

I started off with a pure concept about limiting dependencies and using C, Gtk,
and Pulseaudio.  Because I like GNU, and Gnome, and it seemed like fun.  And
I didn't want too many dependencies, because it hate dealing with dependencies.

So for a year it was a constant swirling of ideas and refactoring, heading
nowhere.  While I never release anything officially, by reconing, I've restarted
the project about six times.

Now, I'm doing something much more conventional.  It is yet another 2D game
engine in SDL2 in C/C++ with some JavaScript for the game logic.

There's not much useful code yet.
