============

This is the README for the Project Burro Game Engine version 0.1.  This is
currently pre-alpha code.  I'm aiming for Dec 2024 release.  The nickname for
version Project Burro v0.1 is "Common Markdown".

This is a 2D game engine I started writing on a whim after reading about the
internals of the Nintendo DS's 2D engine.  I really liked the idea of the
challenge of what was essentially a Nintendo DS simulator.

It is yet another 2D sprite based engine.  For no particular reason than
perversity, it is based on GTK for windowing, Cairo for drawing, Pulseaudio
for sound, and Guile for scripting.

This code not yet usable in any fashion.
